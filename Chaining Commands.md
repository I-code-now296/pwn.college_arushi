# Linux Luminarium: Chaining Commands

##1.  Chaining with Semicolons
This challenge gives command sequencing using the semicolon (`;`) operator. The semicolon acts as a basic statement separator, allowing multiple commands to be executed on a single line. The shell runs the command one after the other, whether the preceding command succeeds or fails.

### Solve

```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IjmUZm9j4AZiXJIO7uJow5mHPft.QX1UDO0wyM3AzNzEzW}
```

## 2. Building on Success
This section covers the **logical AND operator (`&&`)**, which is used for conditional command execution. The command on the right of `&&` will execute **only if** the command on the left successfully completes (i.e., returns an exit code of 0). This is essential for creating robust workflows where one action is dependent on the success of a prior action.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{MkuOR66VoeOgdG7OX5FkdJ1RpEK.0lM0MDOxwyM3AzNzEzW}

Ran them seperately, but I did not get the flag. SO I ran them with the && symbol: 
`/challenge/first-success && /challenge/second`

## 3. Handling Failure
The logical OR operator (`||`), which provides a mechanism for error handling. The command on the right of `||` will execute **only if** the command on the left fails (i.e., returns a non-zero exit code). Either the first command succeeds OR the second command will run.

## 4. Your First Shell Script
This challenge transitions from single-line command chaining to **basic scripting**, where a sequence of commands is placed into a file (a shell script) for execution. The script is executed by explicitly invoking a shell interpreter (like `bash`) and passing the script file as an argument. This is the foundational step for creating reusable and complex automated workflows.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{helloworld}

First I tried to directly exceute `bash x.sh`.
Then I did ls and realised the file does't exist. I created the file, looked up text editors and used nano to write into x.sh.
Excecuted `bash x.sh` again. It worked this time!!
```
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
bash: x.sh: No such file or directory
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ ls

## 5. Redirecting Script Output
This challenge demonstrates that a **shell script is treated as a single command** by the executing shell. Consequently, all output generated by the commands within the script can be collectively redirected (using `>`) or piped (using `|`) to another command or file, enabling the script to function as a powerful, modular data source in a larger pipeline.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{49kq_fFq_z-ebcVrMOZ8raAPyaP.QX4ETO0wyM3AzNzEzW}

/challenge/college #I did ctrl+d here to write the file 
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve

## 6.Executable Shell Scripts
This challenge covers how to make a script directly executable, eliminating the need to explicitly call `bash` every time. This is achieved by setting the **execute permission bit (`chmod +x`)** on the script file, which allows the script to be run via its path (e.g., `./script.sh`). This makes the script behave like a native program or binary.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{helloworld}

```
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ echo /challenge/solve > x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ cat x.sh
/challenge/solve
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ls -l x.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 16 Oct 12 02:51 x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ pwd
/home/hacker
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod +x x.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./x.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:

## 7. Understanding Shebangs
This section explains the role of the **shebang line (`#!`)**, which must be the very first line of a script file. The shebang is a directive read by the Linux kernel that specifies the **interpreter** required to execute the script (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`). This mechanism decouples the script's execution from the invoking shell, ensuring it runs correctly even when called from another program or system process.

## 8. Scripting with Arguments
This challenge introduces how shell scripts can accept and process external **arguments** passed to them at runtime. Arguments are accessed within the script using special variables: `$1` for the first argument, `$2` for the second, and so on. This ability is fundamental for creating flexible and reusable scripts that can operate on variable inputs.

## 9. Scripting with Conditionals
This challenge introduces basic **conditional logic** in Bash using the **`if`** statement. This construct allows the script to execute commands only when a specified condition, such as string equality (`[ "$1" == "pwn" ]`), evaluates to true. This marks the beginning of complex decision-making within automated shell tasks.

### Solve

## 10. Scripting with Default Cases
Building on conditionals, this challenge introduces the **`else` clause**. The `else` statement provides a **default action** that executes if the preceding `if` condition (or any `elif` conditions) evaluates to false. This is crucial for ensuring a script handles all possible inputs or states by providing a fallback path.

## 11. Scripting with Multiple Conditions
This challenge teaches the use of the **`elif` (else if)** clause, allowing a script to test a series of distinct conditions sequentially. Once a condition is met, the corresponding block of code executes, and the script exits the conditional structure. This is the standard pattern for handling multiple specific inputs or scenarios in a robust manner.

## Reading Shell Scripts
This challenge emphasizes the security and administrative practice of **inspecting the source code of shell scripts** (`cat` command) to understand their logic. Since shell scripts are plaintext files, reading them can reveal hardcoded credentials, expected inputs, or internal workings, a critical skill in both system administration and penetration testing.

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{helloworld}

First I cat'd the file to read it. I saw the password "hack the PLANET"
I tried to pass it as an arguement. It didn't work. 
So I tried to pass is as an input using echo. It worked!
```
hacker@chaining~reading-shell-scripts:~$ cat /challenge/run
#!/opt/pwn.college/bash

read GUESS
if [ "$GUESS" == "hack the PLANET" ]
then
        echo "CORRECT! Your flag:"
        cat /flag
else
        echo "Read the /challenge/run file to figure out the correct password!"
fi
hacker@chaining~reading-shell-scripts:~$ /challenge/run "hack the PLANET"

Read the /challenge/run file to figure out the correct password!
hacker@chaining~reading-shell-scripts:~$ echo "hack the PLANET" | /challenge/run
CORRECT! Your flag:
pwn.college{Iyd8zRDm9tnUW1tjsJIt2vXO5sw.0lMwgDOxwyM3AzNzEzW}
